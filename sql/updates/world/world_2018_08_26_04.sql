('3098','1','0','I knew you would come to me, $N. Not because you do not have the will to follow your own path, but because we are kindred spirits. We both have felt pain. We have both suffered.

I\'m sure you can understand.$b$bHave any trouble yet? I\'m glad to hear not. That\'ll change soon enough.'),
('3103','2','0','Ah, at last you\'ve come. I knew you would find your way to me. The Holy Light shines upon you, and the path you\'ve chosen. These times are harsh--the Burning Legion still has a presence upon Azeroth, the entirety of Kalimdor seeks new ways to defend itself from its own tribulations, and it is up to you to aid as many as you can.'),
('3104','6','0','Hello, $N. I am Khelden. Is there something I can do for you?'),

What do you think?'),
('3114','11','0','Yeah, what\'s that, $R? Speak up, if you don\'t mind. I don\'t hear so good after a few ales.'),
('3115','1','0','Wonderful! You got my memorandum obviously.$b$bIgnore the fools around you, $N. The Holy Light?! The sword and shield?! These aren\'t paths for ones as open minded as us. Look at what \"normal\" magic did to our home. Coupled with those damned tinkerers, our race almost became extinct.
